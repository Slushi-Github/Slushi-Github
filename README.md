# Hi there, I'm Slushi! :3

Welcome to my GitHub profile. a nice guy who likes to experiment with whatever comes to his mind and has the ability and time to do so hehe
Also, I love to make public projects so that others can see what my creations do, or just contribute to them.

## About Me:
I started with the development in programming using [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/) in 2022, and so far I'm still strongly into Haxe language hehe.

I don't have a clear goal, I'm just interested in bringing to reality as many ideas that I feel can be good for other people to see, either just visual things that are not playable, or things that are playable, like well, games, or tools that make something simpler.

## Projects I'm Proud Of:
[Slushi Engine](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/Slushi-Engine): It is really my first project with which I started in the world of programming, it is a FNF' engine modified from another engine ([SC Engine](https://github.com/EdwhakKB/SC-SP-ENGINE)), but it adds the possibility for a modder to make modcharts, not only to the [NotITG](https://www.noti.tg/) style, but also to the game window and even to Microsoft Windows elements (Desktop icons, task bar...), in a native way through the Lua API that the engine has.

[HxCompileU](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/hxCompileU): As I love Haxe, a while ago I got a Nintendo Wii U after months of searching, and I wanted the console to learn how to do homebrew on it, but unfortunately, Haxe can't be used on that console, in the past apparently there was an [attempt](https://www.fortressofdoors.com/openfl-for-home-game-consoles/), but not much more from there. This project of mine brings the possibility to use Haxe, on the Wii U in a free way!
- [Leafy Engine](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/leafyEngine): Continuing with my interest in the Wii U, after a lot of time and difficulties, I have managed to create a 2D game engine inspired by [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/), why [HaxeFlixel](https://haxeflixel.com/)? Because it is the engine that I can understand the most and that I feel that the rest that is familiarized with Haxe can also understand, besides allowing the porting of things from HaxeFlixel to this engine without major changes, like [LfSnake](https://github.com/Slushi-Github/LfSnake/) (A port of [FlxSnake](https://haxeflixel.com/demos/FlxSnake/) for that engine).
